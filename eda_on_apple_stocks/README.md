# Project Analysis: Apple Stock Analysis (1980-2022)

This repository contains the analysis of Apple's stock prices from 1980 to 2022. The analysis aims to understand the historical trends, volatility, and potential patterns in Apple's stock prices over the years.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis covers the following key areas:

1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset to understand the structure of Apple's stock prices, including date, opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume.

2. **Data Visualization**: Creating line plots, scatter plots to visualize trends, price patterns, and trading volume fluctuations over time.

3. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics to understand the central tendency and variability of Apple's stock prices.

4. **Moving Averages**: Computing 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify long-term trends and potential support/resistance levels.

## Methodologies Used

The analysis employs the following methodologies:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
- Data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Calculation of summary statistics using NumPy and Pandas.
